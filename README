 Small tool to send AVTransport commands to UPNP media services

 http://nimk.nl/syncstarter

AVRemote aims to be a simple and portable tool to send UPNP commands
to devices supporting the AVTransport 1 and 2 specification. It allows
to control the playback of audio/video files on media players using
the commandline.
     
AVRemote consists of code written in C. Our main goals are simplicity,
speed, portability on embedded devices, small footprint and
reentrancy. We are testing it on the WD HD Live media players.

This software doesn't aims to be a comprehensive implementation of
UPNP controls, please use the MiniUPNP library and tools if AVRemote
doesn't satisfy all your needs, see <http://miniupnp.free.fr>
