#+TITLE: TODO for AVRemote


* Release 1.0								:20%:

** TODO [#A] HTTP streaming URLs load
** TODO [#C] Use a select() call on socket
** TODO [#C] Monitor GetTransportState for results
** DONE [#B] Realize how seek can work
** DONE [#B] Auto detection of devices and ports		  :miniupnpc:

   miniupnpc works, but its mostly designed for internet gateway
   routers and has a lot of overhead (despite the mini in the name).
   it makes sense to rewrite just the messaging that we need.
